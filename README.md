# Cryptocurrencies
Analyzing cryptocurrencies using unsupervised machine learning to group data.

## Overview

In this project cryptocurrency data was preprocessed, scaled, and fitted to an unsupervised machine learning model. PCA was applied to the scaled data to reduce dimensions, and the K-Means algorithm was used to group and label the data.

## Results

After the data was preprocessed and scaled, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was applied to reduce dimensionality from 98 to 3.

An elbow curve was created to determine how many clusters would best fit the data.

K-Means was then initialized with 4 clusters and fitted with the PCA data. Once the predictions were created, a new dataframe was created.

With the class predictions and data all ready, visualizations were created using plotly and hvplot.
